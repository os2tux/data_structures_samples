#****Python 3.6.6****
#This example uses unique indices in its hashmap, which allows us to retrieve a specific
#value by referencing its index. As long as we know the value's index, we can retrieve it
d1 = {
	"123": "joseph",
	"456": "mary sue"
}

print(d1["123])

#This example reuses indices in a hashmap, which will make retrieving a specific
#element impossible since the last value to use that index as a key is what will be 
#retrieved regardless of what the developer intended
d1 = {
	"employee": "joseph",
	"employee": "mary sue"
}

print(d1["employee"])
